# Intermediate JavaScript Course with Women's Coding Collective
In May 2018, I took this short (two hour sessions once a week for two weeks) JavaScript course with the Boston chapter of Girl Develop It.
The project was a portfolio website that used vanilla JavaScript to filter what kind of portfolio items display.
